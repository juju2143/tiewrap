# Tiewrap

Tiewrap is a game engine based on Duktape designed to be simple and efficient, not unlike other projects like LÃ–VE. Program your games in JavaScript just like you would do in HTML, but with the native powers of SDL!

Tiewrap goal is to be simple, portable and shouldn't require any other dependencies than SDL2 and Duktape which has itself no dependencies. As such, it should work everywhere SDL2 has been ported on and have low requirements.

This is a work in progress, feel free to contribute code and documentation. Check the wiki for more information.
